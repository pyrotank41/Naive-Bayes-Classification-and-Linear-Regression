    "### Recap of the Naive Bayes Algorithm  {-}\n",
    "Naive Bayes classification is a fast and simple classification method. Its efficiency stems from some simplifications we make about the underlying probability distributions, namely, the assumption about the conditional independence of features. Suppose for any class $Y$, we have a probability distribution over all possible combinations of values for a feature vector $X$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(X|Y).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The main idea of Bayesian classification is to reverse the direction of dependence --- we want to predict the label based on the features:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(Y|X).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This is made possible by the Bayes theorem:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "P(Y|X) = \\frac{P(X|Y)P(Y)}{P(X)}. \\tag{1}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it more concrete, let us consider the SMS message classification problem. Ignoring punctuations, each SMS message contains an ordered sequence of $T$ words (case-insensitive) $X = \\{X_1, ...,X_T\\}$. That is, $X$ corresponds to an SMS message, and $X_i$ corresponds to the $i$-th word in it. For each message from the training set, there is a corresponding label $Y\\in\\{spam, ham\\}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Model specification and key assumption.** The conditional distribution can be written as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(X|Y) = P(X_1, ..., X_T|Y).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Since this conditional probability is intractable, we simplify it in two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Assume** that all features $X_i$ are independent, conditional on the category $Y$. This leads to a naive Bayes model which writes formally as\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "P(X|Y) = P(X_1, ..., X_T|Y) = \\prod_{i=1}^T P(X_i|Y). \\tag{2}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Assume** that $P(X_i | Y) = P(X_j|Y)$ for all $i \\neq j$.\n",
    "In other words, given the label $Y$, the value of the $7$-th word has the same distribution as the value of the $10$-th word. Note this is not assumed by default in naive Bayes, and we make this additional assumption to significantly simplify our model.\n",
    "It is often referred to as \"tying\" the probability $P(X_i|Y)$ over $i$.\n",
    "As a result, the order of words no longer matters for $P(X|Y)$,\n",
    "i.e., \n",
    "$$P(X=\\text{'cat is cute'}|Y) \\ \\ = \\ \\ P(X=\\text{'cute cat is'}|Y) \\quad \\text{for all } Y.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Plugging Eq (2) into the Bayes theorem in Eq (1), we arrive at\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "P(Y|X) &= \\frac{P(Y) P(X|Y)}{P(X)} = \\frac{P(Y)\\prod_{i=1}^T P(X_i|Y)}{P(X)} \\\\\n",
    "&\\propto P(Y)\\prod_{i=1}^T P(X_i|Y),\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",

    "**Making predictions.**\n",
    "Naturally, given an SMS message $X$, we can first compute $P(Y|X)$ for all possible categories $Y$ (in this example, only two categories), and then make predictions by outputting the $Y$ that maximizes the probability. This can be expressed mathmatically as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\arg\\max_Y P(Y)\\prod_{i=1}^T P(X_i|Y) = \\arg\\max_Y \\left\\{\\log P(Y) + \\sum_{i=1}^T \\log P(X_i|Y) \\right\\}. \\tag{3}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "If there is a tie, we just break it arbitrarily.\n",
    "Here the logarithm uses natural basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning the model.**\n",
    "To apply the prediction rule in Eq (3), we need to first figure out (formally termed \"estimate\") the value of $P(Y)$ and $P(X_i|Y)$ by using the training data. Recall that since we tie the conditional probabilities $P(X_i|Y)$ across all $i$,\n",
    "the subscript $i$ can be dropped.\n",
    "However, we still carry it just for clarity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, $P(Y=y)$ can be estimated by computing the frequency of category $y$ in the whole training set ($y$ can be either \"$spam$\" or \"$ham$\"). Here, in order to avoid confusion, we have used the convention that capital letters denote random variables, and lowercase letters denote their possible instantiations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, $P(X_i = w |Y=y)$ for a word $w$ (e.g., \"cat\") can be estimated by counting the frequency that it appears in the training message set for a given category $y$ (derivation not required in the course):\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "P(X_i &= w|Y=y) \n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "*Remark 1:* If $w$ appears in a single message for 3 times, then it contributes to $Count(w, y)$ by 3, not 1. Similarly, $Count(y)$ indeed equals the total length of all messages in category $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Remark 2:* Obviously, the right-hand side of Eq (4) does not depend on $i$. This is consistent with our previous note that we carry the subscript $i$ in $P(X_i|Y)$ only for clarity, while in fact different $i$ share the same $P(X_i|Y)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose there are four messages \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{{'cat is cute', ham}, {'dog rocks', spam}, {'whatever is is right', ham}, {'hello', spam}.}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Then $P(X_i = '\\text{is}' | \\text{ham}) = 3 / 7$ (**not** $2/7$),\n",
    "and $P(X_i = '\\text{is}' | \\text{spam}) = 0 / 3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quiz (no need to submit): compute $P(X_i = w | \\text{ham})$, for $w = $ 'cat', 'is', 'cute', 'whatever', and 'right'. Check if their sum is 1. Now appreciate why in Remark 1, a word appearing for mulitple times in a single message should be counted multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed that any word $w$ with $Count(w,y)=0$ leads to $P(X_i = w|Y=y) = 0$.\n",
    "As a result, by Eq (2), any message $x$ has conditional probably $P(X = x |Y=y) = 0$ if $w$ appears in $x$.\n",
    "Such a \"veto\" is not favorable, and can create significant problems when a word in the test data has never appeared in the training data (think why?).\n",
    "To bypass this issue, we can add pseudo-count, a.k.a additive smoothing:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{P}(X_i = w|Y=y) = \\frac{Count(w, y) + \\alpha}{Count(y) + N\\alpha}, \\tag{5}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ is a smoothing parameter. $\\alpha=0$ corresponds to no smoothing. In our experiment, let us set $\\alpha = 1.0$. $N$ denotes the number of distinct words in the vocabulary, and let us set $N = 20,000$ in this lab.\n",

    "#### Step 3: compute performance metrics **(5 points)** {-}\n",
    "You may have noticed that the classes are heavily imbalanced. There are only 747 `spam` messages, compared with 4827 `ham` messages. If a classifier simply predicts all messages as `ham`, it will get around 86% accuracy (pretty high). Therefore, accuracy is not a good metric in this case for evaluating the performance of the classifier. As we did before, we can use F-score metrics. But this time we will not implement it from the scratch. Instead, we will learn how to use the builtin methods from `scikit`. [Here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#classification-metrics) is a summary of well-implemented and commonly used metrics for evaluating the quality of a model's predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you need to **report** the testing accuracy, confusion matrix, and F1 score of the Naive Bayes method by choosing proper functions from `scikit` to compute those metrics with required arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: you need to import methods from `sklearn.metrics` before using them."

    "ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curve is one of the most commonly used metrics for evaluating the performance of machine learning algorithms, especially when the classes are imbalanced.\n",

    "ROC is a probability curve for different classes. ROC tells us how good the model is for distinguishing the given classes, in term of the **predicted probability** (not the final hard label in pos/neg). A typical ROC curve has False Positive Rate (FPR) on the $x$-axis and True Positive Rate (TPR) on the $y$-axis. To obtain the FPR and TPR, you can use the `roc_curve` method from `scikit`. This `roc_curve` function takes two arguments: 1) the ground truth labels of the test examples, and 2) the predicted probability that each example is positive. It returns the FPR and TPR which can be used for plotting.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this section, we will explore linear regression model. The dataset we will use for this section is Wine Qualuty, whose description can be found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality). This dataset contains **4898** examples, each containing **11** features (the first 11 columns), and the **last** (12-th) column is the value we want to predict. The dataset can be downloaded here [`winequality-white.csv`](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~zhangx/teaching/winequality-white.csv) (our code will download it directly). \n",
    "\n",
    "Different from classification models, a regression model is used to predict real values rather than the category an example belongs to. Linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between features and real value target. To perform supervised learning, we represent the hypothesis as a linear function of features ($x$) to predict the output ($y$).\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "f(x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1x_1 + ... + \\theta_nx_n    \\tag{8}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $\\theta_i$'s are the **parameters** parameterizing the space of linear functions mapping from $\\mathcal{X}$ to $\\mathcal{Y}$. Our goal is to **learn** these parameters so that we can find a linear function in this hypothesis space to estimate the output $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the notation and ease the computation, we **pad** the input $x$ by letting $x_0=1$. That is, for an example with three features $x=[x_1, x_2, x_3]$, the padded feature vector will be $x=[1,x_1, x_2, x_3]$. Then, the linear function can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "f_\\theta(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^n \\theta_j x_j = \\theta^\\top x    \\tag{9}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where on the right-hand side above we are viewing $\\theta$ and $x$ both as vectors, and here $n = 11$ is the number of features. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a training set, the way to learn these parameters is to make $f_\\theta(x)$ close to $y$. To measure the closeness, we use Mean-Squared-Error (MSE) here. The loss function can therefore be defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "L(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2m}\\sum_{i=1}^m(f_\\theta(x^{(i)})-y^{(i)})^2 = \\frac{1}{2m}\\sum_{i=1}^m(\\theta^\\top x^{(i)}-y^{(i)})^2,  \\tag{10}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where the superscript $(i)$ denotes the $i$-th example, \n",
    "and $m$ is the total number of training samples. To learn the parameter $\\theta$, our goal is to **minimize** the above loss function. In this lab, we will explore two different methods to learn the parameter: \n",

    "1. Gradient descent\n",
    "2. Closed-form solution (root of the gradient)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 Data preprocessing {-}\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have received the dataset, we first need to preprocess it.  Very often, the features in a dataset are of very different scale, which can slow down the optimization for Eq (10). To accelerate it, we need to normalize each feature by substracting its mean value, and then dividing by its standard deviation (std).

    "* If you are working on your own computer, we recommend using the browser (not jupyter) for saving the PDF. For Chrome on a Mac, this is under *File->Print...->Open PDF in Preview*. When the PDF opens in Preview, you can use *Save...* to save it.\n",
    "* Sometimes, a figure that appears near the end of a page can get cut.  In this case, try to add some new lines in the preceding code block so that the figure is pushed to the beginning of the next page.\n",

    "5. The autograder on Gradscope will be open all the time. We designed some simple test cases to help you check wehther your functions is execuable. You will see the results of running autogrder once you submit your code. If you see 'test `function_name` completed', it means your function is execuable; otherwise please follow the error messages to debug. Since those simple test cases are designed for debugging, it does notguaranttee your solution will work well on real dataset. It is your responsibility to make your code logically correct.\n",
